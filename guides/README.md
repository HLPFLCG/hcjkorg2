## How the Site Works (The Short Version)

Your website is built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. It gets deployed automatically to **Cloudflare Pages** every time changes are pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub.

Content lives in two places:

**Markdown files** (for blog posts and poems):
```
content/blog/welcome.md           <- Blog posts (add new .md files here)
content/blog/on-writing-daily.md
content/poems/in-the-quiet-between-us.md  <- Poems (add new .md files here)
content/poems/what-i-was-looking-for.md
```

**Page files** (for everything else):
```
app/page.tsx          <- Home page
app/about/page.tsx    <- About page
app/shop/page.tsx     <- Shop page
app/contact/page.tsx  <- Contact page
app/events/page.tsx   <- Events page
app/book-club/page.tsx <- Book Club Guide
```

You can edit these files directly on GitHub (no coding software needed) -- just click the pencil icon on any file.

## Editing on GitHub (No Software Needed)

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to the file you want to edit
3. Click the **pencil icon** (top right of the file view)
4. Make your changes
5. Click **"Commit changes"**
6. The site will automatically redeploy in ~2 minutes

## What's on the Site

Your site includes:
- **Home** -- Full-screen hero, featured poems, about teaser, book showcase, poem archive teaser, journal teaser, Instagram feed, newsletter signup
- **About** -- Your full bio, "On Writing" philosophy, HLPFL partnership, Press section
- **Poems** -- Archive of all poems, each with its own shareable page
- **Journal (Blog)** -- Blog posts written in markdown, newest first
- **Shop** -- Book covers (front & back), purchase buttons, reader praise, ISBN details, book club CTA
- **Events** -- Upcoming and past readings/events, "Invite Heather" section
- **Book Club Guide** -- 12 discussion questions, themes to explore, sharing CTA
- **Contact** -- Contact info, email, Instagram, and a contact form

Plus behind the scenes: SEO metadata, JSON-LD structured data, a dynamic sitemap, a loading screen, and security headers.

## Book Cover Images

The site includes placeholder SVG images for the book covers. To use the real cover images:

1. Save your front cover image as `public/images/book-cover-front.jpg` (or `.png`)
2. Save your back cover image as `public/images/book-cover-back.jpg` (or `.png`)
3. Update the image references in `app/page.tsx` and `app/shop/page.tsx` — change `.svg` to `.jpg` (or `.png`)
4. Commit and push

The covers appear on the Home page (book showcase section) and the Shop page (both front and back).
